# CoatsinkTest
Unity programming test for Coatsink

Added some test cases to the animation object. 
- Interpolation type will run through the list of basic smoothing types.
- Stress test will load up 10 million keyframes and cycle through, selecting the object in the hierarchy whilst running will cause the system to lag. At least it does on my machine.
- Custom will use the animation frames set in the script inspector.
